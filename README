# UDP Snap

Aim of this project is to provide iOS camera capture triggered by UDP commands from remote device.
In this example an ESP-8266 based rotary pad with H-L293N bridge, HS17 servo and some 3D printed parts.

## ESP8266

App for ESP8266 controls servo by advancing given steps in given interval, which is not exact in order to prevent vibrations.
Posts notifications on steps, so the iOS camera knows when is the right time to capture numbered step.

## iOS

* Minimal app in Swift 4 for iOS 11+, features latest photo capture APIs and server built on IBM's BlueSocket framework.
* App starts UDP server and performs camera capture directly to iCloud drive Documents when notified by ESP8266 client.
* UDP commands are received over WiFi from device acquired over MDNS on the same network.
* The communication is bi-directional, sending following commands: `PLAY`, `STOP`, `REWIND`.
* Client app is additionaly able to configure turntable jitter and time-lapse interval using commands `JIT:<Int, millis>! and `INT:<Int, seconds>`.

## Roadmap

* App should be able to reset container and/or order projects in folders in future.
