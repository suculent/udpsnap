# UDP Snap

Aim of this project is to provide iOS camera capture triggered by UDP commands.
UDP commands come from device aquired over MDNS.
In this example an ESP-8266 based rotary pad with H-L293N bridge, HS17 servo and some 3D printed parts.
The communication may be extended to bi-directional, sending commands like ROTATE, STOP, REWIND or RESET to control the pad.
